Test Game for Frank Engine
Copyright 2013 Frank Force

The goal of the "Test Game" project is to keep the code as simple as
possible to provide a clean slate for starting a fresh project.  It also just
helps provide an understanding of what is necessary to set up a game and
serves as an example of some of the basic functionality.

If you want to start a new project as a copy of this project just export
or branch the TestGame folder to a new folder for your project, and rename 
TestGame.vcxproj and TestGame.vcxproj.filters to your project name.
Then add your new project to the solution and it should just work.
